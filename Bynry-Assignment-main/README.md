# ProfilePeek

ProfilePeek is a simple web app that allows users to search and view profiles of people they know. With just a name search, users can see a person's brief profile summary and their location on the map.

## Features

- **Profile Search**: Search for people by their names and view their detailed profiles.
- **Profile Summary**: Get a quick summary of the person with brief information.
- **Map Integration**: View the person's location on an interactive map.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: Built using React to render the UI components and handle client-side logic.
- **Styling**: Styled with CSS (or any framework you're using like Bootstrap or Material-UI).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnkurBombarde/Bynry-Assignment.git


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
